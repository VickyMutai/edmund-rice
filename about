The Congregation of Christian Brothers arrived in Eldoret in 2009 with the aim of offering holistic support for the needs of the local community, particularly in Langas and Yamumbi. They established the Edmund Rice Eldoret Empowerment Programme (EREEP) to provide hope and empowerment to the people of Eldoret. The program emerged from the grassroots exploration of Brothers Sunday Otieno and Paul Mutuku in 2013 and has since become a flourishing ministry. Guided by a new strategic plan, EREEP will continue to offer hope and empowerment to the people of Langas-Yamumbi. The Christian Brothers and their co-workers are grateful for the guidance and support provided by Move on Afrika consultancy firm.
